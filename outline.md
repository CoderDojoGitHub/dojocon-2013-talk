# Better, Together

Starting a new CoderDojo is a daunting solitary process. Kids that are learning can feel alone. Organizers of dojos can feel alone. Dojos themselves can be completely alone. If we can create a collaborative environment where people and dojos coexist, we can grow much stronger, together.

- **Event**: DojoCon 2013
- **Duration**: 30 mins

## Intro
- I'm @cameronmcefee, mentor at CoderDojo GitHub
- I hate friction
 - Build tools
 - Reduce clutter
 - Form <del>over</del> in harmony with function.
- GitHub
 - Make it easier to work together than alone.
- CoderDojo
 - Follow our example, but figure it out yourself.
- We need to work together.

## Inception is hard
- CoderDojo is confusing
  - Five start-up guides
  - Three sites
  - Not all public facing informational sites are open source.
- Starting a dojo is confusing.
  - Where do I find a venue?
  - Where do I find mentors?
  - Where do I get lessons?
  - What do I do first?
- Running a dojo is confusing
  - Dear GitHub: How do you run your dojo?
  - Dear GitHub: Can I come watch how your dojo runs?
  - Dear GitHub: Is there a mentor mailing list?
  - Dear GitHub: Is there a lesson wiki?
- Running a dojo is time consuming.
  - We have day jobs
  - We have families.
  - We have hobbies.

## Analysis 
- Pros:
  - Lots of info
  - Lots of experience
  - Lost of resources
- Cons:
  - Too much information
  - Open ended instructions
- CoderDojo provides suggestions, not support.
- You (organizer and dojo) are on your own.

## Run the dojo, together
- GitHub helps coders work together
  - Collaboration
  - Version control
  - Issue tracking
  - Wikis
  - Free websites
- Designed with code and collaboration in mind
- Free organization accounts for dojos (This isn't a sales pitch)
  - 10 private repos, unlimited public repos, unlimited teams
  1. Create a GitHub organization for your dojo
  2. Email support@github.com
  3. Request free CoderDojo organization coupon.
  4. Provide some sort of proof 
- Lesson-Plans repo
  - Create issues for each session date
  - Discuss lesson topics, teacher, etc.
- Each lesson has its own repo
  - Have a lesson template
  - Create a repo from the template
  - Include a license
- Private mentor tickets repo
  - Add mentors as collaborators to the repo.
    - Prove they exist on the internet
    - Have lunch with them before adding. No creeps.
  - Post ticket links in dated issues.
    - Mentors can manage subscription settings
    - Target specific mentor skills with mentor teams.

## Build the future, together
- I invasion a better, collaborative future.
- Simple jumpstart guide.
  - One version/format
  - Easy, concise steps
- Open Source Almost Everything
- CoderDojo Bootstrap Kit
  - Everything you need to get started
  - Custom.
- Automatically and optionally set up apps, GitHub, lessons
- Event creation, ticket distribution
- Coppa compliant student and mentor management
  - This one is tricky
- Easy lesson front end
  - Home page: current lesson. Same url every week
  - Lessons: index of past lessons
  - GitHub backend
- Click Checkboxes next to the things you want. It deploys to Heroku for you.
- Welcome to your dojo
- When you start a dojo, CoderDojo starts it with you.

## Share knowledge, together
- Teaching: What *you* think is important
- Mentoring: What *they* think is important
- Dress the part.
  - Don't look like a teacher. Teachers teach at you.
  - Look like a peer. Mentors share knowledge.
  - Don't force it. It's not about being cool. It's about not being superior.
- Mentor at eye level.
  - Kneel next to the person you're mentoring.
  - Eye level means you are peers.
  - Don't teach. Share knowledge.

## Learn together
- Learning together is important.
- Look around. Shake hands with everyone that is one person away from you.
- Network demo. Learning together.

# Thank you
You're no longer alone.
